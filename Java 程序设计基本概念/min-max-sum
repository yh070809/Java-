Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

For example,arr = [1,3,5,7,9] . Our minimum sum is 1+3+5+7=16 and our maximum sum is 3+5+7+9=24 . We would print

16,24

Function Description

Complete the miniMaxSum function in the editor below. It should print two space-separated integers on one line: the minimum sum and the maximum sum of 4 of 5 elements.

miniMaxSum has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of 5 integers

Sample Input

1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output

10 14

Explanation

Our initial numbers are 1,2 ,3 4,5 , and . We can calculate the following sums using four of the five integers:

If we sum everything except 1, our sum is 14.
If we sum everything except 2, our sum is 13.
If we sum everything except 3, our sum is 12.
If we sum everything except 4, our sum is 11.
If we sum everything except 5, our sum is 10.

long sum = 0;
        long min = 1000000000;
        long max = 0;
        while(scan.hasNext()) {
            long n = scan.nextLong();
            sum = sum + n;
            if (min > n) {
                min = n;
            }
            if (max < n) {
                max = n;
            }
        }
        scan.close();
        
        System.out.println((sum - max) + " " + (sum - min));
