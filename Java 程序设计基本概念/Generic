Generic methods are a very efficient way to handle multiple datatypes using a single method. This problem will test your knowledge on Java Generic methods.

Let's say you have an integer array and a string array. You have to write a single method printArray that can print all the elements of both arrays. The method should be able to accept both integer arrays or string arrays.

You are given code in the editor. Complete the code so that it prints the following lines:

1
2
3
Hello
World
Do not use method overloading because your answer will not be accepted.



We can use Java Generic concept to print an array of objects, then invoke the generic method to print Integer arrays, Double arrays, String arrays etc.

In the java generic method declaration, a type parameter section delimited by angle brackets (< and >) precedes the method's return type.

The body of the generic method is declared like any other method and we use type parameters like T, E to represent reference types, primitive types like int, float are not used.

public static < E > void printArray( E[] inputArray ){    
     for ( E element : inputArray ){        
        System.out.println( element );
     }
}
